# Semantic Search Engine
This is an end-to-end search engine that is designed to interact with a MySQL database. This engine allows users to ask questions in natural language. It then translates these questions into SQL queries and executes them on the MySQL database to retrieve answers. We're implementing this technology at AtliQ Tees, a T-shirt store that manages its inventory, sales, and discount data using a MySQL database.
